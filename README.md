# Inventory Management Application

This project is a Python-based inventory management application that
allows users to interact with a MySQL database through a web
interface. It allows users to perform various database queries using complex 
SQL operations such as set operations, subqueries with WITH clauses, 
advanced aggregates, and OLAP queries. The system also provides a 
user-friendly interface for CRUD operations, and features robust error handling 
to ensure smooth user experience.

## Features

-   **Create Record**: Allows inserting new records into specified tables, ensuring the necessary constraints are met.

-   **Read Record**: Retrieves and displays all records from the selected table.

-   **Update Record**: Modifies existing records in the database using primary key(s) for identification.

-   **Delete Record**: Deletes specific records from a table based on primary key(s).

-   **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for invalid options, database connection issues, and constraint violations.

## Supported Tables

The application supports the following tables:

1.  customer

2.  customer_order

    1.  customer_order_items

3.  inventory

4.  product

5.  product\_ category

6.  supplier

7.  order_process

    1.  processed_line_items

8.  User

These tables are managed using primary keys, and relationships between them are enforced by the application logic.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x installed on your system.

-   MySQL server running with a valid database schema.

-   MySQL Connector for Python (pymsql, sqlalchemy, python-dotenv
    package).

### Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2.  Install the MySQL connector package if not already installed:
```bash
pip install django python-dotenv crispy-bootstrap5
```
3.  Update the database connection credentials in the .env file with the
    parameters below:
```bash
DATABASE_USER=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
DATABASE_NAME=
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_PORT=
```
The database schema - the required tables and relationships will be created once you run migrations.

## Usage

1.  **Run the application**:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
 ```
2.  **Menu Options**:

-   The application will display a menu with five options:

    -   Create a new record

    -   Read a record

    -   Update a record

    -   Delete a record

    -   Exit

-   Choose an option by entering the corresponding number (1-5).

3.  **CRUD Operations**:

-   Create: Select a table, then provide the required fields. The
    application checks for constraints like foreign key relationships
    before insertion.

-   Read: Select a table to view all its records.

-   Update: Choose the table, specify the primary key(s), and update the values.

-   Delete: Choose the table and provide the primary key(s) to delete
    the record.

4.  **Exit**:

-   To exit the application, select option 5. The application will close
    the database connection.

## Error Handling

-   **Database Connection**: If the application fails to connect to the
    MySQL database, it displays an error message and exits gracefully.

-   **Invalid Menu Options**: If an invalid menu option is selected, the
    application prompts the user to try again.

-   **Table and Column Selection**:

    -   The application validates the user\'s choice when selecting
        tables and columns.

    -   If a non-existent or invalid option is chosen, the application
        provides feedback and asks the user to make a valid selection.

-   **Constraint Violations**: The application enforces foreign key
    constraints. If a user tries to insert a record with a non-existent
    ID in a referenced table, it displays an error message.

-   **Business Logic Validation**: The application enforces business
    logic while updating or deleting records (EX: if customer order
    already processed then it will not let you update or delete)

## Code Structure

### DBManager Class

This class is responsible for handling all database interactions and
operations. It contains the following methods:

-   init: Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.

-   create_record: Inserts new records into the specified table.

-   read_record: Retrieves and displays all records from the selected
    table.

-   update_record: Updates a record based on the specified primary key
    and column.

-   delete_record: Deletes a record using the primary key(s) for
    identification.

-   read_records_and_sub_records: Prints main records and its
    sub-records together (useful for viewing customer order/order
    processing)

-   close_connection: Closes the database connection when the
    application exits.

### main_crud_function Function

This function manages the application flow:

-   Displays the main menu.

-   Takes user input for various operations.

-   Calls the appropriate methods from the DBManager class based on the
    user's choice.
